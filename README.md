# Sentence-generator :fire:
A generator written in python that allows you to give it a list of words for the Start, End, Middle. It will then pick random words out of those and create a sentence out of them.

# Usage
### Editing word list:
  When you start editing the code you should see something like
  `start = "example ", "example2 "`
  Replace these with your own words! (When adding new words remember to put "," after all your words!)
  
  
  If not obvious when your generating the order of words goes Start, Middle, Middle2, End.
  
  
  If you dont want middle2 then comment out `middle2 = ["foo2 ", "foo3 " ]` and remove c from `post = a + b + c + d`
  
 ### Running
 If not obvious run "$ python gen.py"
